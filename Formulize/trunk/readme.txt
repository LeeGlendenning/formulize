This verison of Formulize is a release candidate for version 4, with an all-new admin UI.  Please pay special attention to any parts of your site that use frameworks (now called relationships).  Also, please pay special attention to the admin UI, and make sure that it is showing you correct information, and saving your information properly.  The entire UI has changed, so that's a lot of opportunity for something to be missed.

Let us know how it goes!
