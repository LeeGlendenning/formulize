How to install banners
=============================

banners is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete
"banners" folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as
administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the banners icon in the list of uninstalled
modules and click the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

In addition, you have to move the smarty plugin:
Source:      /modules/banners/plugins/function.banners.php
Destination: /libraries/smarty/icms_plugins/function.banners.php
Further, you might want to delete /modules/banners/plugins/*.* including the folder itself
since it's not needed in this place.
