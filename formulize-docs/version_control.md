# Version Control

We use [Github](www.github.com/jegelstaff/formulize/) as our version control system.  We have a unified process in Github for:

* [New Features and Branching](branching/)
* [Testing](testing.md)
* [Documentation](documentation.md)
* [Code Review, Pull Requests and Merging](merging.md)
