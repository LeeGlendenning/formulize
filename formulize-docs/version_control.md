# Version Control

We use [Github](http://www.github.com/jegelstaff/formulize/) as our version control system.  We have a unified process in Github for branching, testing, documentation and merging:

+ Checkout the master branch 
+ Create a new brand based on master
+ Start a pull request an GitHub
+ Make code changes, push to your branch regularly
+ Create Selenium tests
+ Verify that the tests work in the Cl environment
+ Update/create documentation where applicable
+ Give "thumbs up" in your pull request when you think it is ready
+ A maintainer will review the pull request and merge it
+ A maintainer will publish the documentation updates, if any

For more details about each major part of this process, see the following pages:

* [New Features and Branching](branching)
* [Testing](testing)
* [Documentation](documentation)
* [Code Review, Pull Requests and Merging](merging)
