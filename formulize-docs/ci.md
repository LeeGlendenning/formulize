# Continuous Integration

We use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/jegelstaff/formulize/builds) and [Sauce Labs](http://www.saucelabs.com) as our continuous integration platform.  We currently test only using Selenium 2 in-browser tests of the Formulize application.  This page describes the configuration and setup of our integration with these CI tools.
